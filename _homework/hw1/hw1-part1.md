## Variables and Algebraic Operations

**Problem 1:**

Create variables $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ in the script below, defined by

* $$a = \frac{2-3^\pi}{{6} + e^{-\sqrt{2}}\sin(\pi/12)$$
* $$b = \sqrt{\pi + 1}\frac{e^3-3}{e^3-5}$$
* $$c = 1.2^{3.1} + (2 + 3\sqrt{2})/4$$


**Problem 2:**

Define variables $$x$$, $$y$$, $$z$$, and $$w$$ by

* $$x = 2.1$$
* $$y = 3.3$$
* $$z = (y+x)/(y-x)$$
* $$w = x^y$$

Then using these variables, calculate the following quantity

$$q = \frac{x^2-y^2}{z^2-w^2} + xyzw$$

**Problem 3:**

Newton's Law of Cooling says that the temperature $$T$$ of an object as a function of time $$t$$ is

$$T(t) = T_{\text{room}} + (T_0-T_{\text{room}})e^{-rt},$$

where here $$T_{\text{room}}$$ is the temperature of the room, $$T_0$$ is the initial temperature of the object, and $$r$$ is the heat capacitance of the object (how well it retains it's temperature).

We can find the inverse of the above function to get an expression for how long it takes an object to reach a temperature $$T$$.   Doing so gives the equation

$$t = -\frac{1}{r}\ln\left(\frac{T-T_{\text{room}}}{T_0-T_{\text{room}}}\right).$$
