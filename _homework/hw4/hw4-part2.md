## Sum More Function Practice

**Problem 2:**

The $$n$$'th **Basel sum** is the quantity

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{n^2}.$$

Create a function called *basel_sum* whose input is an integer $$n$$ and whose output is the $$n$$'th Basel sum.
