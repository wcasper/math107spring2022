Work out each of the following problems **by hand** and be sure to show your work.  Scan your written solutions and upload them as a **single** PDF.
Be sure to show your work!  Solutions without work will receive very little credit.

**Problem 1:**

Determine by hand an LU decomposition for each of the following matrices

* (a)

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
3 & 1\\
1 & 3
\end{array}
\right]$$

* (b)

$$B = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 0 & 1\\
4 & 1 & 3\\
6 &-1 & 3
\end{array}
\right]$$

**Problem 2:**

Consider the matrix

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0
\end{array}
\right]$$

* (a) Determine the eigenvalues of the matrix $$A$$
* (b) Explain why $$A$$ does not have a diagonalization

**Problem 3:**

Consider the matrix

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}
\right]$$

Show that $$A$$ does not have an LU factorization.
